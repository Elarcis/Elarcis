## Elarcis, streamer and webdev üêô

Hi, I‚Äôm Lars (he/him), I‚Äôve been a developer since 2009. Here I mostly work on proprietary software and contribute to FOSS projects, but I usually host my own stuff publicly on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/elarcis). 

I‚Äôve worked on a wide spectrum of technologies, from databases and Business Intelligence to web frontends and serverless apps, but I really prefer the latter.

I value **accessible** user interfaces, **simple but organised** architectures, self-explanatory code and type-driven **correctness**, i.e. designing-out incorrect uses of my code.

### What I do üíñ

- I code on private company repos (sowwy UwU)
- I stream (in french) on [twitch.tv/Elarcis](https://www.twitch.tv/elarcis)
- I switch between pet projects and interests every other week ü§ì
